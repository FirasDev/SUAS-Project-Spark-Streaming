The anti-AS forces are supported by 2 Ethiopian battalions based in Luuq and Garbaharey. Similar movements were reported from Dhoobley towards Afmadow on 20/05. The move is apparently the first step of a new offensive targeting Bardheere and Berdale. Latest reports however indicate that the anti-AS forces based in Luuq and Bohol Bashiir are currently divided over the arrests of some TFG MPs and other militia commanders, mainly from the Hadame sub-clan, by Ethiopia. A group now accuses Kiish Buur, leader of the ex-TFG militias from Baidoa, of being behind these arrests and refuses to fight until their colleagues are released. The offensive towards Berdale/Baidoa will probably be postponed until this issue is resolved",0
